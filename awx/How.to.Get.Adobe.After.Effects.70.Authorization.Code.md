To use Adobe After Effects 7.0, you need to activate it with an authorization code. An authorization code is a unique number that verifies your license and allows you to use the software. However, the activation server for Adobe After Effects 7.0 and earlier versions is no longer available[^2^]. This means that you cannot use your original disc or serial number to get an authorization code.
 
Fortunately, Adobe has provided a solution for this issue. You can download a special version of Adobe After Effects 7.0 that does not require activation from their website[^2^]. You also need to use a special serial number that is provided on the same page. This serial number will work only with the special version of Adobe After Effects 7.0 that you download from the website.
 
To get Adobe After Effects 7.0 authorization code, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/cs2-product-downloads.html?promoid=19SCDRQK) on Adobe's website.
2. Sign in with your Adobe ID and password.
3. Scroll down to the section "After Effects CS2" and click on "Download".
4. Choose your language and operating system.
5. Save the file to your computer and unzip it.
6. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
7. When prompted for a serial number, enter the one that is given on the website under "After Effects CS2".
8. Complete the installation and launch Adobe After Effects 7.0.
9. You do not need to enter an authorization code as the software is already activated.

You can now use Adobe After Effects 7.0 without any problems. However, note that this version of Adobe After Effects 7.0 is not compatible with newer versions of Adobe After Effects[^1^]. If you want to use newer features and updates, you need to upgrade to a newer version of Adobe After Effects.
  
Adobe After Effects 7.0 is a powerful software that can help you create stunning animations and effects for your videos. However, it can also be challenging to learn and use. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you get started with Adobe After Effects 7.0:

- Watch some tutorials. There are many online resources that can teach you the basics and advanced features of Adobe After Effects 7.0. You can find some official tutorials on [Adobe's website](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/tutorials.html), or you can search for other tutorials on YouTube or other platforms.
- Use presets and templates. Adobe After Effects 7.0 comes with many presets and templates that can help you create common effects and animations quickly and easily. You can find them in the Effects & Presets panel or the File > Browse Template Projects menu. You can also download more presets and templates from [Adobe Exchange](https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=productHome&exc=16&loc=en_us) or other websites.
- Experiment with keyframes and expressions. Keyframes are the building blocks of animations in Adobe After Effects 7.0. They allow you to control the values of properties over time. You can create keyframes by clicking on the stopwatch icon next to a property name, or by using the keyboard shortcut Alt/Option + click. You can also use expressions to create more complex and dynamic animations. Expressions are snippets of code that link properties to other properties, values, or functions. You can write expressions by using the pick whip tool or by typing them in the expression field.
- Use pre-compositions and nesting. Pre-compositions and nesting are techniques that allow you to group layers together and treat them as a single layer. This can help you organize your project, simplify your timeline, and apply effects or transformations to multiple layers at once. You can create a pre-composition by selecting the layers you want to group and choosing Layer > Pre-compose. You can also drag a composition from the Project panel into another composition to nest it.
- Render and export your project. When you are done with your project, you need to render and export it to a video file that you can play, share, or edit further. You can render and export your project by using the Render Queue panel or the Adobe Media Encoder application. The Render Queue panel allows you to set up multiple render items with different settings and formats. The Adobe Media Encoder application allows you to export your project to multiple formats and presets in the background while you continue working in Adobe After Effects 7.0.

These are some of the basic tips and tricks that can help you get started with Adobe After Effects 7.0. However, there is much more to learn and explore in this software. You can find more information and resources on [Adobe's website](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects.html) or on other online platforms.
